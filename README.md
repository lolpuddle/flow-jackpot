# Flow Jackpot

**Currently a WIP (there is literally still syntax errors)**

Meant to be an example of an onchain NFT jackpot. This was designed with NBA Topshot Moments in mind as the specific type of NFT, but can be used to setup a jackpot style game for any NFT available onchain.

## Future Developments:
- Add frontend interface
- Integrate with a pricing oracle so the randomness is weighted based on the value of NFTs submitted to the pot. i.e. if you submit a $50 NFT in a pot that summed up to $100, your odds of winning should be 50%
- Some sort of better way to escrow the pot. Nothing is stopping the account hosting the jackpot game to run away with the pot
